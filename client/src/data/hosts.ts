    bio: "Linda Green is a retired Licensed Clinical Social Worker who has spent her life helping others find hope, healing, and stability. With a heart for service, she worked in some of the most challenging areas—drug addiction, behavioral health, and foster care—offering compassion and support to individuals and families when they needed it most.\n\nOver the past decade, Linda Green has turned her focus toward fundraising, where she's combined her deep empathy with strategic know-how to connect vital resources to causes that make a real difference in the community.\n\nBut her commitment doesn't stop there.\n\nLinda Green has always believed in the power of community and has generously given her time to local boards, including The Children's Services Board and Parks and Recreation. One of her proudest accomplishments was championing the designation of State Road 714 as a state Scenic Highway—preserving a stunning stretch of native canopy trees for generations to come.\n\nWhether through advocacy, storytelling, or service, Linda is passionate about bringing people together and sparking meaningful conversations that inform, inspire, and ignite positive change.\n\nThat spirit continues with Connected Circles, a podcast she created to nurture the emotional, practical, and relational well-being of everyday people. Through heartfelt conversations, expert insights, and honest storytelling, the podcast explores the real-life complexities of relationships, parenting, friendships, money, and health—both physical and mental. Connected Circles is here to support, empower, and connect listeners as they navigate the beautiful, messy, and meaningful journey of life.",
